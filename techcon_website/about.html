                <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
                <p>
                    Born out of necessity during one of the most challenging periods in recent history, <strong>TechCon</strong> began its journey in <strong>2019</strong>. As the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face interactions became nearly impossible, yet the need for collaboration in the tech space only intensified. Amidst lockdowns and global uncertainty, TechCon emerged as a virtual beacon—bringing together developers, thinkers, and innovators to tackle the rapidly evolving challenges of the digital age.

                <p>
                    The inaugural conference provided a fully online platform where software developers from across the globe could exchange ideas, build tools, and propose solutions—all from the safety of their homes. It was more than just a workaround; it was a revolutionary way to unify the developer community in a time of crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the world transitioned out of the pandemic, TechCon evolved with it. From 2022 onwards, the conference reintroduced <strong>physical meetups</strong> while maintaining its global reach through hybrid experiences. These in-person events have since sparked deeper collaboration, richer experiences, and the birth of visionary projects.

                <p>
                    One such innovation is <strong>GradForce</strong>—a powerful solution for university graduates that combines entrepreneurial training, internship matching, and job-readiness programs, including immersive virtual interview simulators. Launched after TechCon 2023, GradForce has empowered countless graduates to confidently step into the workforce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With successful editions in <strong>2022, 2023,</strong> and <strong>2024</strong>, TechCon has grown into a movement—bridging gaps, solving real-world problems, and setting the pace for the future of tech. As we look to 2025, the mission remains unchanged: connect, create, and catalyze change through code.
